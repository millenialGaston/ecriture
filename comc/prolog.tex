Im'supposed to be aware -- \\
made of obvious neccessities, such\\
as cold brewed heart felt fantasies --\\
shallow in some of\\
its ripples, but good\\
aware of its reenactments, precise\\
narratives;--
even of knowledge of rhymes\\
which make sense \& \& \&!\\
The infinite sadness of a tinder\\
swipe -- , gentle ripples of loneliness\\
why hmmm let me dare say repenting for\\
, yes,  criminal senselessness\\
-- injured third parties were present\\
\phantom{} quite probably. \\ 
oh But \textit{d'ailleurs entendons nous}\\
one need not stay, in fact C. \\
ran to the slopes nearby \& slept\\
through it as high \\
as I might have been, am, this sort\\
this flesh ; narcissic and as self-conscious\\
as blessed kind as one can as (be?), \\
hidden, crouched beneath clear streams\\
and long plants sardines and sunflowers \\
the year was 2020
--not so far off, palpable and of a distinct aura\\
ranging from pale pinks to hues of tanned\\
athletic youths\\
One can find them , over the ridge ; Emboddied \\

metaphores eschewing the minds aglaze\\
across, \& rooting not so the glimmer of a finger\\
The rebooted prototype Matrix of graphic designed\\
lush curves and cinematic profiles\\
enhancing but yes!yes!yes! the first movement\\
in the glimmer the beauty is in the pastel\\
palettes ; the eyebrows and the clean smooth pouches\\
In some sense it does yes absolutely perspire\\
to the surface; molecules the taste the scent of \\
well of everything \\
I have seen the crescant of the moon\\
when the wolves whisper to you you must\\
die, not becaus we do not like you but because\\
it, simply is so.\\

goals must be engaged through precipices, imagined or grounded in pure truth but the difference
matters less than one might think, the wolves do not need truth, they need to not 
be shot at, they are frail and loose and outnumbered. Moon and wolves are 
a common place locus of wilderness strength and despair. The hungry teenager
might think of a wolf as some spiritual namesaker, however when  C. 
has finally inculcalted himself some knowledge, he will dream of manatees, or 
sea cows, the big mammals shapped as fat dolphins -- hang out in shallow
waters in peace and feed on algua, letting themselves drown in the bliss
warm maters before being reborn.\\
The first step towards those ambitious endeavours in to find that\\
\phantom{ } \hspace{1cm}good weed.

I have committed, \\
the only crimes that befit me\\
i can only make sense of it through coherence,\\
some blinking skeleton of structure\\
this is what I've been trying at \\
to tell you in this letter.\\

My life without you is steps on glass.\\

	Sincerely Yours,\\
Your Dutchess

I have seen snowy mountains drunken half dead\\
paraplegic lost veterans stricken by PTSD\\
out of a single Foo Fighter song, shitting\\
through their last long johns crying\\
crying some blues they wish meant something\\
