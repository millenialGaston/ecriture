I don't remember when it is I woke up
Our mutual breaths smelling of ashburnt
coffee, sweet and fetid turned milk, 
In your armpits, mouth, thighs
and licking the tenderness in your eyes
We lay there in the afterglow
of sunday morning blowjobs and clumsy sex
Indolence with hair spreaded in unrolling
waves, flowing towards naked awareness
The empty sounds of idleness caressing
our awkward youth in its apathy of
ambiguous consolations
I sprayed some empty words lying at your side
the first perilous act of doing
replacing our best rest at simply being
Trying to hold to when were it was I woke up
When beauty was a side act
and the main show lingered as half-consciousness

It could have been
First gestures and yawns
morning drunkenly silent walks
endlessness as warm toast
buttered with ripe avocados
in quiet sequences, instead
I waited for the first word
to produce ideas of a normal self
reflected in similes of our 
content smiles

you put your rigid skirt on
looking through the mirror
as the 
so called real world was waiting
for yourself and friends and charity
and ideas and integrity, I turned and felt
breadcrumbs easing into my waist
leaving smooth remains of sweet pain
waiting for the world to wait for me
knowing how I childish it were and I noticed
You spoke to my penis in aphorisms
brushed your teeth  and combed your hair
blossoming into a distinct I was not ready for
I woke up amidst a lost sock, a caffeine stained 
t shirt and stepping on a used condom
slipped onto a dream and decided to stay there
for a while
at least

Leave the key in the plant pot
You can keep sleeping, I have to go to work

Yes and I woke up and started looking
in your apartment for a lost cigarette,
cold coffee, maybe a microwave
putting on my cynical jeans and
egg yolk hands empty stare
numbness and stomach aches
only finding your keys 
next to the coffe machine
opening and closing some door
and wondering which flower pot
as there were several of them
and a simple mistake could mean
waking up in the wrong morning
