so here it is, I don't know how happened but I am 28 high drinking tea and
reading "On the origins of totalitarianism" at 2am, enduced to go every 20 min
to go outside to suck in way too big drafts of cigarettes while thinking to
myself, seriously at that, "sell outs, all of them fuking sell outs". I guess
this is why I don't believe in fate, how can you be predestined to this shit --
probably why I cling to tragedy in relationships too, on a theoretical basis,
as in literature criticism etc., my life so far is clearly destined to the
comedy register, but this is poorly scripted, the jokes are not funny enough,
theres no impact, no rhythm, contrived, somebody is yelling in the background:
"Hey can we get some pathos in heree please, for the love of god, this
derivative neurotic shit was overplayed in the 60s." Am I a good person in the
specifics, does it matter; I feel guilty most of the time -- that ought to do
it, and if not, well, itd be like I might as well be a liberated asshole, why
agonize over it.
