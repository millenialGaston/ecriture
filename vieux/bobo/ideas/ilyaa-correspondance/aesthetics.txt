
		
dominant aesthetic = dominant ideology and dominant classes

early 2000 s = computers YEAHH + post feminism + meritocracy + worldwide education
2 broad sortes de films (batard but for the sake)
Les films de l'establishment qui utilisent l esthetique la plus pervasive 
pour renforcer l immersion et le lien empathique. Et les films qui flip plus le shit
et utilisent plus "consciemment" une esthetique et drive un point et ont plus de contenu etc.
0 = establishment
1 = flip le shit
s = index de flip le shit
Examples:

2000-2010, dominant aesthetic is fundamentally techno-utopian
	-Jason Bourne  (s = 0.5): form : 	quick cuts, all shiny and shit, empowered woman in scenario, happy ending against
										the bad guys
							 ideas: 	fundamentally optmistic; you got game then you can fuck the system
										surveillance is pervasive and kind of bad. The establishment sucks, but hey, it s not 
										systematic, it s because of bad people. Overall were good (see gladiator
										for reference that ends with; "well the whole problem was that we had 
										a false bad emperor, not that we got EMPERORS WITH POWER OF LIFE AND DEATH AND SHIT")
										
	-Casino Royalle (s = 0): form : well much copied jason bourne #1 on the way the action is portrayed, rugged and quick
									cuts and shit. ideas the same as Jason bourne but no tinge of "fuck the system", mostly
									lets get the bad guys 80's style
									
	-all psy movies (s=0 generally)
	
	-21 grams (s = wait what)
	- cohen brothers (s = 1)
	- Pta (s = 1)
	
	
									
2010-2017, main ideaology : ah shit, it aint that good, were alianated by phones and tinder, what about VINYLS, VINYS ARE NICE, oh ISIS, 
	-Her (s=1)
	-grand budapest hotel (s = hmmm)
	-tony erdman s = 1
	
	
	
	
shit my inner anarchie has awaken and im analyzing the aesthetics of films with how much they collude with systems of dominance and
capitalism, imma stop right there, just know that this is often in the back of my mind, I try to reframe it in a more interesting
way but somehow the boring communist frameworks come back

TLDR: This is wayyyy too complicated, every body has a conceptual framework when shit gets complicated, 
		i just wrote to myself mine is anarchism, interesting, i knew it but didnt think i was that close to it
