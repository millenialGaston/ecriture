pyramids-oedipus
psychoanalysis use of jargon to make 
apparent that simple abstractions
are universal. Because Jargon extracts
the semantics from colloquial context
At the end of the day using fancy
words makes it seem more removed
from daily reality, hence more external
hence objective. There is a basic failure 
to realize that simple patterns are universal
because they are simple. The same way pyramids are
found accross the globe in different cultures 
that had no contact with each other. Because
pyramids are the simplest way to put blocs together
to form a tall buildling.
In this social scientists polarize people in 
a quite stupid way all in all. Using specific 
jargon to illustrate tautologies to seem more objective
in the process making what they say harder to understand.
It is quite natural that someone perceiving the inherent
simplicity of these concepts ends up finding social
sciences masturbatory or pedantic. Making
something harder to understand means decontextualizing it
hence making it seem more objective for speakers of the jargon.
This is a bad process
